# vim-pythonic-environment-set-up
Project for providing best experience for python apps development 

The .vimrc file is based off the following tutorial https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/

I've added some features:
- Save a session (many open windows), as well as save modified files and exit run **:mks!** an a Session.vim file will be created. For save and exit run **:Xs**
- Running the current window script pressing **py**
- Integrated terminal macros hitting **Ctrl+t**. To quit the terminal macros use **Ctrl+\** with **Ctrl+n** and finally **:q!**.
- Remap **Esc** to **jk**. This actually helps get you more confortable and faster. 

Next new feature could be to open jupyter notebooks
